The [Serverless Framework Enterprise](https://app.serverless.com/) console is a SaaS solution that augments the Serverless Framework CLI with everything you need to operate and run your serverless applications. It provides out-of-the-box monitoring, alerts, secrets, policy enforcement and more. 

The Serverless Framework Enterprise free tier is designed to give individual developers everything they need to develop and troubleshoot serverless applications more efficiently. The free tier provides full access to the Serverless Framework Enterprise console, but is limited to 1,000,000 function invocations per month. If you are interested in expanding your usage of the Serverless Framework Enterprise beyond the free tier [contact us](https://serverless.com/enterprise/contact/) for details re available plans and pricing.
