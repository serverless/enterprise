# Setup an AWS Account for use with Serverless

The Serverless Framework needs access to your cloud provider's account so that it can create and manage resources on your behalf.

This guide is for the Amazon Web Services (AWS), so we'll step through the process of setting up a credential for AWS and using them with Serverless.


### Sign up for AWS

If you already have an AWS account, skip to the next task. If you don't have an AWS account, use the following procedure to create one.

To create an AWS account
1. Open https://aws.amazon.com/, and then choose to Create an AWS Account.  
2. Follow the online instructions.
  + Part of the sign-up procedure involves receiving a phone call and entering a PIN using the phone keypad.

Note your AWS account ID, because you'll need it for the next task.

If you're new to Amazon Web Services, make sure you put in a credit card.

All AWS users get access to the Free Tier for [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/pricing/). AWS Lambda is part of the non-expiring [AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/#AWS_FREE_TIER).

If you don't have a credit card set up, you may not be able to deploy your resources and you may run into this error:

```
AWS Access Key Id needs a subscription for the service
```

While in the AWS Free Tier, you can build an entire application on AWS Lambda, AWS API Gateway, and more, without getting charged for 1 year...  As long as you don't exceed the resources in the free tier, of course.


### Create an IAM User and Access Key

Services in AWS, such as AWS Lambda, require that you provide credentials when you access them, so that the service can determine whether you have permissions to access the resources owned by that service. You can create access keys for your AWS account. However, AWS doesn't recommend that you access AWS using the credentials for your AWS account. Instead, they recommend that you use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM). Create an IAM user, add the user to an IAM group with administrative permissions, and then grant administrative permissions to the IAM user that you created. You can then access AWS using a special URL and that IAM user's credentials.

If you signed up for AWS, but you haven't created an IAM user for yourself, you can create one using the IAM console.

*NOTE*: This guide assumes you have am IAM user with administrator privileges. Please note that we only recommend using an IAM user with administrator permissions for development and on a completely different AWS account from your production one. In production, it is much more secure to use an IAM user that has the minimum set of permissions necessary for performing your deployment.

- To create an IAM user for yourself and add the user to an Administrators group
  1. Sign in to the Identity and Access Management (IAM) console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/.
  2. In the navigation pane, choose `Users`, and then choose `Add user`.
  3. For `User name`, type a user name, `adminuser`.
  4. Select the checkboxes next to `Programmatic access` and `AWS Management Console access`
  5. Select Custom password, and then type the new user's password in the text box.
    + Note down your username and password for later use.
  6. Unselect the checkbox next to `Require password reset`.
  7. Choose `Next: Permissions`.
  8. On the `Set permissions for user` page, choose `Add user to group`.
  9. Choose `Create group.`
  10. In the `Create group` dialog box, type the name `admins` for the new group.
  11. For `Filter`, choose `Job function`.  
  12. In the policy list, select the checkbox for `AdministratorAccess`.
  13. Now choose `Create group`.
  14. Back in the list of groups, ensure the checkbox is selected for your new group. Choose `Refresh` if necessary to see the group in the list.
  15. Choose `Next: Review` to see the list of group memberships to be added to the new user. When you are ready to proceed, choose `Create user`.
- Note down the following from the `Success` page
  + name of your IAM user
  + AWS `Access key ID`
  + AWS `Secret access key`


### Using AWS Access Keys

You can configure the Serverless Framework to use your AWS **API Key** & **Secret** in two ways:

#### Quick Setup

As a quick setup to get started you can export them as environment variables so they would be accessible to Serverless and the AWS SDK in your shell:

```bash
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<your-key-here>
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<your-secret-key-here>
# AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY are now available for serverless to use
serverless deploy

# 'export' command is valid only for unix shells. In Windows - use 'set' instead of 'export'
```

**Please note:** *If you are using a self-signed certificate you'll need to do one of the following:*
```bash
# String example:
# if using the 'ca' variable, your certificate contents should replace the newline character with '\n'
export ca="-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----...-----END CERTIFICATE-----"
# or multiple, comma separated
export ca="-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----...-----END CERTIFICATE-----,-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----...-----END CERTIFICATE-----"

# File example:
# if using the 'cafile' variable, your certificate contents should not contain '\n'
export cafile="/path/to/cafile.pem"
# or multiple, comma-separated
export cafile="/path/to/cafile1.pem,/path/to/cafile2.pem"


# 'export' command is valid only for Unix shells. In Windows - use 'set' instead of 'export'
```


#### Using AWS Profiles

For a more permanent solution, you can also set up credentials through AWS profiles. Here are different methods you can use to do so.

##### Setup with `serverless config credentials` command

Serverless provides a convenient way to configure AWS profiles with the help of the `serverless config credentials` command.

Here's an example of how you can configure the `default` AWS profile:

```bash
serverless config credentials --provider aws --key AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE --secret wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY
```

Take a look at the [`config` CLI reference](../cli-reference/config-credentials.md) for more information about credential configuration.

##### Setup with the `aws-cli`

To set them up through the `aws-cli` [install it first](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/installing.html) then run `aws configure` [to configure the aws-cli and credentials](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html):

```bash
$ aws configure
AWS Access Key ID [None]: AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE
AWS Secret Access Key [None]: wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY
Default region name [None]: us-west-2
Default output format [None]: ENTER
```

Credentials are stored in INI format in `~/.aws/credentials`, which you can edit directly if needed. You can change the path to the credentials file via the AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE environment variable. Read more about that file in the [AWS documentation](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html#cli-config-files)

You can even set up different profiles for different accounts, which can be used by Serverless as well. To specify a default profile to use, you can add a `profile` setting to your `provider` configuration in `serverless.yml`:

```yml
service: new-service
provider:
  name: aws
  runtime: nodejs6.10
  stage: dev
  profile: devProfile
```

##### Use an existing AWS Profile

To easily switch between projects without the need to do `aws configure` every time you can use environment variables.
For example you define different profiles in `~/.aws/credentials`

```ini
[profileName1]
aws_access_key_id=***************
aws_secret_access_key=***************

[profileName2]
aws_access_key_id=***************
aws_secret_access_key=***************
```

Now you can switch per project (/ API) by executing once when you start your project:

`export AWS_PROFILE="profileName2" && export AWS_REGION=eu-west-1`.

in the Terminal. Now everything is set to execute all the `serverless` CLI options like `sls deploy`.
The AWS region setting is to prevent issues with specific services, so adapt if you need another default region.

##### Using the `aws-profile` option

You can always specify the profile which should be used via the `aws-profile` option like this:

```bash
serverless deploy --aws-profile devProfile
```

#### Per Stage Profiles

As an advanced use-case, you can deploy different stages to different accounts by using different profiles per stage. In order to use different profiles per stage, you must leverage [variables](https://serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/variables) and the provider profile setting.

This example `serverless.yml` snippet will load the profile depending upon the stage specified in the command line options (or default to 'dev' if unspecified);

```yml
service: new-service
provider:
  name: aws
  runtime: nodejs6.10
  stage: ${opt:stage, self:custom.defaultStage}
  profile: ${self:custom.profiles.${self:provider.stage}}
custom:
  defaultStage: dev
  profiles:
    dev: devProfile
    prod: prodProfile
```

#### Profile in place with the 'invoke local' command

**Be aware!** Due to the way AWS IAM and the local environment works, if you invoke your lambda functions locally using the CLI command `serverless invoke local -f ...` the IAM role/profile could be (and probably is) different from the one set in the `serverless.yml` configuration file.
Thus, most likely, a different set of permissions will be in place, altering the interaction between your lambda functions and other AWS resources.

*Please, refer to the [`invoke local`](https://serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/cli-reference/invoke-local/#aws---invoke-local) CLI command documentation for more details.*
